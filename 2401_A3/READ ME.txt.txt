in order to compile type in 
	gcc parkingSimulator.c - lm
	gcc simulator2.c -lm


Was not to sure how to incorporate setHours in a beneficial way so,
I wrote it how the assignment wanted it, for parkingSimulator.c
and wrote it differently for simulator2.c, so id acutally incorporate 
it into my code.
